/**
 * Per-connection WebSocket adapter for TheLink server subscriptions.
 *
 * Wraps a single accepted WebSocket connection with TheLink-compatible inbound
 * and outbound tunnels. Server code can use each connection Link to publish events to
 * one client and receive events from that client.
 *
 * Outbound events are serialized into `{ type: "message", data: [...] }`
 * envelopes using a simple `[event, ...values]` event tuple.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * server.onSubscribe((socket) => {
 *     socket.autoJoin(server)
 *     socket.$inbound.subscribe("client:event", handleClientEvent)
 * })
 * ```
